# Tic-Tac-Toe-js
Game Development using javascript

Overview


This project is a classic Tic Tac Toe game built using pure JavaScript. It serves as a practical demonstration of various core JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, arrays, and functions.

Features


1. Interactive and responsive game board
2. Real-time game state updates
3. Dynamic win detection and game reset functionality
4. Clean and simple user interface

Usage


Simply open the index.html file in your web browser to start playing the game. Click on any cell in the game grid to make your move. The game will automatically switch turns between the two players (X and O) and detect the winner or a draw.

Code Structure


1. index.html: The main HTML file that structures the game layout.
2. style.css: The CSS file that styles the game board and elements.
3. script.js: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and functionality.


Learning Objectives

This project was designed to reinforce the following JavaScript concepts:

1. DOM Manipulation: Creating and updating HTML elements dynamically.
2. Event Handling: Capturing and responding to user interactions.
3. Conditional Logic: Implementing game rules and determining the winner.
4. Arrays and Loops: Managing game state and iterating over game board cells.
5. Functions: Organizing code into reusable blocks for clarity and maintainability.
6. ES6 Features: Using modern JavaScript syntax such as arrow functions, template literals, and let/const.
